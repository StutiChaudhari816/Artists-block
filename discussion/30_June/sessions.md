# Previous blockers/updates:
- Scoping problem statement: 
    - brainstorming on a problem statement
        - think about things that motivate/love
        - or a challenge already faced
    - exploring corresponding apps/previous solutions to find loopholes
    - scope out problem and solution from the challenge
    - create an overview flowchart of what is input to project model, what is the expected output, what happens behind the scene in the model

# Topics Discussed:
- Deliverables of the project:
    - code
    - report: with details
    - presentation: overview
    - video: demo showcase [optional]

- Github codebase:
    - running code
    - pulling/pushing changes from PR and branches
    - versioning code for each accesibility and transpirancy

# Next Steps:
- Code base for 3 chatbot ( completion task and not conversation )
    - craftman: materials, idea-> project overview
    - poetry: starting words, feelings-> completing poetry
    - music: starting notes, lyrics, sound like-> complete notes
- 3 llm calls with individual prompts (elaborate and instructive)
- UI website interface
- home page button:
- button: refresh and start again

# Future works:
- craftman: rather than just overview: people can get details instructions on clicking title
- poetry/music: ensure nothing resembles anything on internet: check can be ensured by another llm as a judge
- login page: go back to history of generations
- conversational bot: contains previous context
